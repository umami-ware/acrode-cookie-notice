# Acrode Cookie Notice for WordPress
> Especially from developers for developers.


Acrode Cookie Notice allows you to elegantly inform users that your site uses cookies. This plugin also helps website owners to comply with the EU cookie laws.

## :trophy:&nbsp; Features
- [x] **GDPR and ePrivacy compliant**\
The privacy settings allow your users to easily enable and disable cookies. By giving your users the ability to accept or reject specific cookies or cookie groups, their data can be protected and stored in a targeted manner.
- [x] **Supports all latest browsers**\
We make sure that the latest version of every modern Browser is supported (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, Opera, Microsoft Edge).
- [x] **Super lightweight (~7,8 kb)**\
We want to keep it as simple as possible, so it only contains, what really is necessary for the function.
- [x] **No Dependencies**\
To keep everything as clean as possible this plugin does not have any external dependencies - not even jQuery!
- [x] **Easily customizable for developers**\
You can customize the cookie message and buttons, set cookie expiry and much more.
You want to write your own CSS? Sure, just write your own and the default will not even be loaded.


## :white_check_mark:&nbsp; Requirements
Cookie Notice requires:
* WordPress installation with version 5.6 or higher
* PHP version higher or equal to 8.0


## :rocket:&nbsp; Installation & Documentation

1. Download the latest version of the Cookie Notice in the `release` tab.
2. Log into the backend of your WordPress site and install the downloaded .zip
3. After install, activate the plugin.
4. You can configure the settings of the plugin in `Settings` => `Cookie Notice`.

### Styling & Layout customization
You are able to customize the styling of the plugin. For this you can write your own CSS styling for the cookie notice.

1. **Create folder structure to overwrite/extend defaults**\
Navigate to your `wp-content` folder and create an `acrode` folder there. Then navigate to this folder and create a folder `acrode-cookie-notice`. In this folder all files for your custom configuration are placed.
2. **Overwrite styling**\
If you want to overwrite the default CSS styling create a `front.css` file in `wp-content/acrode/acrode-cookie-notice`. You can place your custom CSS code for styling the frontend layout of the cookie notice in this file. To keep the plugin as lightweight as possible, the default `front.css` will not be loaded anymore - so its necessary to handle the complete styling of cookie notice in this file.
